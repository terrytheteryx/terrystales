She has stout legs and a rectangular body. In addition, her eyes have large arches above them, similarly to a Heliolisk. On less noticeable topics, she has three tail leaves compared to two, her wrists do not have leaves, and she has three toes and fingers compared to two. Her crest leaf is also comparably shorter and drifts on her left side.</p>
